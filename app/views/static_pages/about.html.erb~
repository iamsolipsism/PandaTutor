<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
So you've taken a class and passed it with an A+. Now you're looking to teach someone. Or maybe you're looking for someone who has taken the class before to help you.

This website is dedicated to bringing to gether both young and new university students and the battle-hardened straight A nerd who is looking to help.

For you students in need of help, find tutors who go to your school, what class they took, and what grade they got.

For you top students, just post which classes you've taken and what grade you got in them. Its that easy. 

So what are you waiting for? There's someone who needs help and there's a helping hand waiting for you.
